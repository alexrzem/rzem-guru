### Midjourney
* [midjourney.com](https://www.midjourney.com/explore)
::: info
*Midjourney is an independent, self-funded research lab focused on "exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species" through AI-powered image generation technology.*

*The platform is renowned for its distinctive stylized and artistic image outputs, allowing users to transform text prompts into high-quality digital renders ranging from photorealistic imagery to artistic interpretations in various styles.*

*While primarily accessed through Discord, Midjourney also offers a web interface where users can create, edit, and organize their AI-generated images through subscription plans that range from the Basic tier at $10/month with 200 generations to the Pro plan at $60/month with more extensive capabilities.*

*The company recently released V7, their first new AI image model in nearly a year, described as "the smartest, most beautiful, most coherent model yet" with improved text prompt understanding and image quality featuring "beautiful textures, and bodies, hands, and objects of all kinds have significantly better coherence."*

*Midjourney provides users with various tools to refine and customize their creations, including upscaling, variations, draft mode for rapid iterations, and even a personalization system that learns users' preferences through image ratings.*

*The company is led by founder David Holz (previously of Leap Motion) and comprises a small team of 11 full-time staff supported by high-profile advisors including Jim Keller (former lead silicon engineer at Apple, AMD, and Tesla) and Nat Friedman (former CEO of GitHub).*

### Sora
* [sora.com](https://sora.com/explore)
::: info
*Sora is an advanced text-to-video AI model developed by OpenAI that can "create realistic and imaginative scenes from text instructions," generating videos up to a minute long while maintaining high visual quality and adherence to user prompts.*

*The model employs a diffusion-based transformer architecture that starts with static noise and gradually transforms it by removing the noise over many steps, representing videos and images as collections of smaller data units called patches.*

*Initially released to a small "red team" for adversarial testing and select creative professionals for feedback, Sora was eventually made available to ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Pro users in December 2024.*

*Sora demonstrates impressive capabilities such as generating complex scenes with multiple characters, specific motion types, and accurate subject and background details, while also being able to animate still images and extend existing videos.*

*Despite its strengths, OpenAI acknowledges that the model may struggle "with accurately simulating the physics of a complex scene, and may not understand specific instances of cause and effect" or reliably interpret precise descriptions of temporal events.*

*To address potential misuse, OpenAI has implemented safety measures including detection classifiers to identify AI-generated content, plans to include C2PA metadata in future deployments, and leverages existing safety methods from their other products to reject prompts that violate usage policies.*
