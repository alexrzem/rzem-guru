# AI Risk Assessment Frameworks

1. **Algorithmic Impact Assessment (AIA) Framework**
   - Evaluates potential societal impacts of AI systems before deployment
   - Includes stakeholder consultation processes and documentation requirements
   - Determines appropriate oversight levels based on risk categorization

2. **Technical Robustness Framework**
   - Assesses reliability, security, and resilience of AI systems
   - Includes testing protocols for accuracy, precision, and generalization capabilities
   - Evaluates vulnerability to adversarial attacks and system failures

3. **Ethical AI Assessment Framework**
   - Evaluates AI systems against ethical principles (fairness, transparency, accountability)
   - Includes methodology for identifying and mitigating bias in training data and algorithms
   - Provides governance mechanisms for ethical decision-making

4. **AI Compliance Framework**
   - Maps AI systems against relevant regulatory requirements (sector-specific and geographic)
   - Includes documentation processes for demonstrating compliance
   - Outlines procedures for regulatory reporting and disclosure

5. **Model Governance Framework**
   - Establishes processes for model documentation, versioning, and change management
   - Defines roles and responsibilities for model oversight
   - Creates audit trails for model development and deployment decisions

6. **AI Risk Quantification Framework**
   - Methodology for quantifying different types of AI risks (reputational, operational, financial)
   - Includes metrics and thresholds for acceptable risk levels
   - Provides tools for risk prioritization and resource allocation

7. **Responsible AI Deployment Framework**
   - Guidelines for responsible release strategies and monitoring
   - Includes processes for continuous evaluation post-deployment
   - Defines incident response protocols for AI system failures

8. **Human-AI Interaction Risk Framework**
   - Assesses risks at the interface between humans and AI systems
   - Evaluates appropriate levels of human oversight and intervention
   - Includes transparency requirements for end-users
