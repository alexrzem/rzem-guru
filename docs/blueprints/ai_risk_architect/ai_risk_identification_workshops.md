# Ethical Transparency Protocol (ETP)

The Ethical Transparency Protocol establishes standards for explaining AI ethical reasoning and decision-making to various stakeholders. This blueprint provides approaches for making ethical considerations visible, understandable, and accessible to those affected by or interested in AI systems.

The ETP would contain:

\- Specifications for different levels of ethical explanations for different audiences  
\- Traceability requirements linking decisions to underlying ethical principles  
\- Documentation standards for ethical design choices and trade-offs  
\- Communicative frameworks for conveying ethical reasoning processes  
\- Visualization methods for complex ethical decisions  
\- Audit trail requirements for retrospective ethical analysis
