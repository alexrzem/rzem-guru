# Moral Uncertainty Framework (MUF)

The Moral Uncertainty Framework addresses how AI systems should operate when faced with genuine moral uncertainty or competing ethical frameworks. This blueprint provides methodologies for representing ethical uncertainty within systems and establishing principled approaches for decision-making under such uncertainty.

The MUF would contain:

\- Models for representing ethical uncertainty within decision-making systems  
\- Meta-ethical frameworks for navigating between competing moral theories  
\- Principles for ethical decision-making under uncertainty  
\- Methods for tracking moral credences and updating them based on new information  
\- Protocols for ethical deliberation when faced with novel moral questions  
\- Deferral mechanisms for appropriately escalating decisions to human judgment
