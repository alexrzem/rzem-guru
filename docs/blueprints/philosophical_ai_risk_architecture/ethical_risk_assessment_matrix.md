# Ethical Risk Assessment Matrix (ERAM)

The Ethical Risk Assessment Matrix provides structured approaches for identifying, categorizing, and managing ethical risks throughout the AI development lifecycle. This blueprint enables organizations to anticipate and mitigate potential ethical failures before they manifest.

The ERAM would contain:

\- Comprehensive catalogs of potential ethical failure modes  
\- Probability and impact metrics for various ethical risks  
\- Decision trees for evaluating competing ethical considerations  
\- Scenario planning methodologies for anticipating novel ethical dilemmas  
\- Stakeholder impact analysis frameworks  
\- Longitudinal risk tracking mechanisms to monitor evolving ethical concerns

## Risk Taxonomy

#### Harm Categorization
  - Physical harm taxonomy
  - Psychological harm classification
  - Social and community harm frameworks
  - Economic harm categories
  - Dignity and autonomy violations
  - Environmental harm considerations

#### Risk Source Classification
  - Technical failure sources (e.g., robustness issues, specification problems)
  - Deployment context mismatches
  - Misalignment with stakeholder values
  - Malicious use scenarios
  - Emergent risk categories
  - Interaction effects

#### Temporal Risk Dimensions
  - Immediate vs. delayed risks
  - Cumulative effect considerations
  - Irreversibility factors
  - Risk evolution patterns
  - Long-term risk horizons
