# Ethical Learning Safeguards (ELS)

The Ethical Learning Safeguards ensure that as AI systems learn and evolve, they maintain or improve their ethical alignment rather than degrading it. This blueprint provides approaches for establishing boundaries on permissible learning, monitoring for potential drift, and implementing corrective measures when necessary.

The ELS would contain:

\- Boundaries for permissible ethical drift during learning  
\- Monitoring systems for detecting value misalignment in learned behaviors  
\- Intervention protocols when learning leads toward ethical problems  
\- Value preservation mechanisms during knowledge transfer  
\- Ethical regression testing frameworks  
\- Feedback mechanisms to strengthen alignment through learning

## Value Stability Principles
