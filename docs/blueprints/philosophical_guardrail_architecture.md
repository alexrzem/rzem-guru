# Philosophical Guardrail Architecture (PGA)

The Philosophical Guardrail Architecture details technical implementations of ethical boundaries that prevent AI systems from operating outside established ethical parameters. This blueprint provides concrete approaches for translating ethical principles into system constraints and safeguards.

The PGA would contain:

\- Specifications for hard ethical constraints that cannot be violated  
\- Designs for soft ethical constraints that require additional verification  
\- Implementations of ethical tripwires that trigger human review  
\- Formal verification methods for ethical boundary conditions  
\- Circuit breaker designs for graceful system shutdown when ethical boundaries are approached  
\- Override protocols for exceptional circumstances with appropriate accountability mechanisms
